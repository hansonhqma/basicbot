                    <h2>How it works:</h2>
                    <p>In probability theory, a Markov chain is a stochastic model that describes a
                    sequence of possible following events in which the probability of each event is exclusively
                    dependent on the state attained in the previous event. Markov chains satisfy the "Markov Property",
                    or can also be categorized as "memory-less". A stochastic process is said to satisfy the Markov Property
                    if the conditional probability distribution of all future states depends only on the current state, and not any state that preceded it.
                    <br>Markov chains can be used to generate text by building "reference trees" using dictionaries.
                    A string of text is read and reformatted to add an end-of-sentence tag, which tells the program when
                    to stop building this specific Markov chain path. Text is then generated by randomly selecting child states,
                    or "nodes", from the current state, and following this tree until the end-of-sentence tag is reached, at which point a sentence is generated.</p>
